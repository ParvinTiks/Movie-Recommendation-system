**MOTIVATION:** With the overwhelming number of movies available across various platforms, users often struggle to decide what to watch. this challenge, known as decision fatigue, can make the movie-watching less enjoyable. so we thought of how to make this easier. so we came out with an idea to address this problem by developing a personalized movie recommendation system, that helps the user with choosing the movie, based on past choices.by simplifying the movie selection process, the system not only saves time but also enhances user satisfaction, offering a seamless and enjoyable experience for every tase.


**GOAL:** Our goal was to make a system that gives users movie suggestions based on other movies they have seen and liked. It should take into consideration movie genres, actors and ratings to make an accurate prediction and recommend a movie that the user should enjoy.
